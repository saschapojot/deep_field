This folder is based on the folder more_layer_double_quantum
with batch normalization layers

1. train_qt_dqnn.py
2. test_qt_dqnn.py
3. plot loss during training using plt_qt_log.py
4. plt_one_N.py to plot test error  vs linear model error
5. stats_qt_trainData.py to get stats of test data
6. large_lattice_test_qt_dqnn.py to test on larger lattice
7. rescaled_err_large_lattice_test_qt_dqnn.py to get rescaled error
8. plt_coefs.py, to get visualization of layers
